# Homework Assignment 7

**Overview**. For the urgent care simulation model you developed in the last homework assignment, 
we would like to add a simulation trace to track what exactly happens to each patients, 
plot different sample paths, and report several performance statistics. 
For this assignment, you should feel free to use any part of the code in 
the [solution of HW_6](https://github.com/HPM573/HW_6_Solution), and 
 the [discrete-event simulation lab](https://github.com/HPM573/Lab_DiscreteEventSimulation). 
 Assume that the urgent care is open for only 20 hours and that we can set the warm-up period to 0. 

**Problem 1: Simulation Trace (Weight 1)**. 
Modify your code so that you can produce the trace of what exactly is happening throughout the simulation.

**Problem 2: Sample Paths (Weight 1)**. Plot the sample paths of: 
- Patients in the system
- Patients waiting to see the mental health specialist
- Utilization of primary care physician
- Utilization of mental health specialist

**Problem 3: Performance Measures (Weight 1)**. Report the following performance measures:
- Average patient time in system
- Average patient waiting time to see the primary care physician
- Average patient waiting time to see the mental health specialist
